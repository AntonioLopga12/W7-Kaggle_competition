# CHALLENGES WILL BE FACED, LEARN FROM THEM, DON'T BECOME THEM.

**REQUIREMENTS**

- Train a minimum of **4 different models**

- Perform **Feature Extraction and Engineering** techniques

- Documentation needed to reproduce the code.

- The code in .py and/or .ipynb files that allows to reproduce the exercise.

- Functions must be in modules. ;)(src folder with .py files)

- The Readme must contain a summary of the machine learning tools and algorithms
  and the results or the score obtained with each of them.
  
- A slide (just one) That show an overview of your project)-README.



**STEPS:**

1. Explore The Dataset

2. Remove Column Collinearity.

3. Handle Missing Values

4. Handle WHOIS_* Categorical Data

5. Handle Remaining Categorical Data & Convert to Ordinal

6. Modeling, Prediction, and Evaluation


### Day 1 – Saturday


**Plannification of the proyect.**

Identify the steps to follow.


**Analyse and understand the steps in order to have a general idea of the ML proccees.**
    
   - Take your time, Study the process.
    
   - Look some exaples of standard proceedure.
    
   - Develop your own standard proceedure.
    
    

Some steps that could be part of the process: (**VERIFY and COMPLETE them! *CRUCIAL**)

   - Read carefully README document!!



### Day 2 – Sunday

**PROYECT STEPS:**
1. Explore The Dataset

2. Remove Column Collinearity.

3. Handle Missing Values

4. Handle WHOIS_* Categorical Data

5. Handle Remaining Categorical Data & Convert to Ordinal

IF TIME:


6. Modeling, Prediction, and Evaluation

**1 PREDICCTION PER DAY**

Some steps that could be part of the process:

Read carefully README document!!
    
   - First Data Look.
    
   - Understand the Data. (If noot look to into it again, from another perspective.)
    
   - Understand the problem.

   - See coorilation between the different variables. (Apply formula from the last exercise)
    
                                                    @@LA CLAVE ESTA EN LOS DATOS!!!!@@  

   - **Start cleaning & Transforming** the DataFrame. - DROP, columns & rows that after your evaluation you belive arent going         to add value, but noise.
    
   - Data Tranformation, LOOK for standard methods and apply.
   
### Day 3 – Monday

**PROYECT STEPS:**
6. Modeling, Prediction, and Evaluation

**1 PREDICCTION PER DAY**

- Tranformation of the Data, LOOK for standard methods and apply.
    
- Prepare the models H2o or PyCarete

**Evaluate the Models:**
    
  - MOST IMPORTANT ONE! MATRIZ DE CONFUSION!!
    * Numeric 
      (MSE,RMSE,MAE,R2,ADJUSTED R2)
      
    * CATEGORICAL ?? ( Are this methos to evaluate only the binary columns?)
      (ACCURACY,PRECISSION,RECALL, F1_SCORE)
      
**IF TOO GOOD or BAD SUPERVISE DATA**

### Day 4 – Tuesday
**PROYECT STEPS:**
6. Modeling, Prediction, and Evaluation


**1 PREDICCTION PER DAY**

**IF TOO GOOD or BAD SUPERVISE DATA**

### Day 5 – Wendnesday

**PROYECT STEPS:**

6. Modeling, Prediction, and Evaluation

**1 PREDICCTION PER DAY**


**IF TOO GOOD or BAD SUPERVISE DATA**

### Day 6 – Thursday
    
- **Prepare all the data and documents to deliver on Time.**
